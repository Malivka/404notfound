## 💡 Key Highlights

* Clear, concept-first ML explanations for beginners and intermediate learners.
* Examples covering:

  * **Regression** (Linear, Logistic, Polynomial)
  * **Classification** (KNN, Decision Trees, SVM, etc.)
  * **Model Evaluation** (Holdout, K-Fold, Cross-Validation)
  * **Data Preprocessing** (Scaling, Encoding, Imputation)
* Step-by-step Jupyter notebooks with separate cells for clarity.
* Notes aligned with practical code for easy reference.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab
* Libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn
```

### Running the Code

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deeptesh-rout/your-repo-name.git
```

2. Navigate to a folder:

```bash
cd your-repo-name/MLC ALL CODE
```

3. Open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Run the cells to explore code and examples.

## 🧠 Learning Approach

* **Hands-on coding first** — implement models and experiments.
* **Concepts explained** — clear notes accompanying each example.
* **Stepwise evaluation** — from Holdout to K-Fold to advanced model validation.
* **Modular code** — reusable and easy to adapt for different datasets.
